# Overview about source code file:
- This script appears to cover a comprehensive analysis of sales and customer data, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, segmentation, and clustering. 
- The provided GitHub link allows for further exploration of the project's details and source code.
# How to use:
- First, you should download file data, then import to your code folder.
- Python enviroment and Jupyter enviroment are required to run the code, so make sure you have it on your computer.
1. Import libraries: 
- If you can not import libraries, you can try open PythonScripts on your computer and then use command: pip install [name of library].
2. Read Salesdata and Data cleaning 
- Read it by command: df = pd.read_csv("Salesdata.csv").
- Drop unnescessary columns, just store nesscessary data for calculating RFM values: " CustomerKey" "SALE ORDER" "ORDER DATE" "Sales Amount" columns.
- Change column name, the column name is already pretty good, but our team prefer use lowercase and use underscore instead of space, it's easier to read and code.
- Checking if the OrderDate column data match the format by returning the min and max of day/month/year.
3. Descriptive Analysis 
- Conducts descriptive analysis on the sales data.
4. G values
- Read file "Customerdata.csv".
- Drop unesscessary columns, groupby "country_region" and calculate "sum_sales_of_country" from monetary.
5. RFM values
- Calculate R values and create R table with customer_key 
- Calculate F values and create F table with customer_key 
- Calculate M values and create M table with customer_key 
- Merge R, F, M Table into 1 dataframe 
- Decribe it to know about count, mean, standard, min, max, quartiles.
- EDA RFMG.
- Find outlier values.
6. Transformation 
 - Chose boxcox transformation because it had lowest standard.
 - Then, StandardScaler boxcox values.
7. Standardization (Z score) 
- Scales and standardizes the data using Z scores.
- Comparison Transformed data and Standardized data.
8. Calculate RFM score and Segmentation
- Calculates RFM scores for each customer.
- Segments customers based on RFM scores.
- Visualize Segmentation by bar chart, pie chart
9. K-mean , Elbow, Silhouette
- Using data which are standardized to cluster customers by K-means.
- Box plot to visualize relationship between cluster Id vs monetary.
- Box plot to visualize relationship between cluster Id vs frequency.
- Box plot to visualize relationship between cluster Id vs recency.
10. Calculate CLV 
- Import data from AHP and calculate CLV.
